# How to set up Bluetooth on your Raspberry Pi

Bluetooth connectivity can be used to transfer files and for communication, but it also lets you use game controllers such at the Nintendo Wiimote and the PS3 controller for robotics.

You will need a Bluetooth dongle. Not all adaptors work on the Pi; we can't specifically recommend any but the Inateck Bluetooth 4.0 adaptor we are using works really well.

## Connect the dongle and install software

- Plug the dongle into a USB port on your Pi and boot it up.
- At the command line type `sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends bluetooth`.
- Once the software is installed, type `sudo service bluetooth status`.

You should see `bluetooth is running`. If not, reboot and try again.

## Test the dongle

Type `hcitool scan`. Any Bluetooth discoverable devices in the area will appear on screen; you are now ready to use Bluetooth on the Raspberry Pi.
 
If you don't see anything, make sure that you have a phone or other Bluetooth-enabled device near the Pi and discoverable.
