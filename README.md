This guide shows you how to build and control a Raspberry Pi-powered robot with a Nintendo Wiimote.

## Requirements

As well as a Raspberry Pi with an SD card loaded with Raspbian, you'll also need:

### Hardware

- Robot chassis - [Rover 5](http://proto-pic.co.uk/dagu-rover-5-tracked-chassis-with-encoders/). This includes 2 motors and a battery pack.
- Motor controller, such as the [Ryanteck motor controller](http://ryanteck.uk/rtk-000-001/)
- Input device - Nintendo Wiimote
- Bluetooth dongle to talk to the Wiimote
- USB rechargeable battery to power the Raspberry Pi like [this one from the PiHut](http://thepihut.com/products/portable-power-pack-for-the-raspberry-pi)

### Software

- Software packages to use Bluetooth
- Python libraries for the Wiimote

Instructions on installing this software is given in the worksheet.
